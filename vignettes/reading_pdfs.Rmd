## Using the electrical bill function

Rocky Mountain Power commercial electrical bills include a list of buildings on the first page. Notice the list in the image shown below.  This is the first page of the *example_powerbill.pdf* included with the package. See that the named buildings are just below the address and that they have a meter number associated on the same line.

By providing the text name of the building we can then process the data from the multi-page pdf and find the energy usage from that monthly building.  Let's pull the data for the following buildings.

- East Bldg
- Main Bldg
- Bldg 85
- West Bldg 1
- West Bldg 2


```{r}
path <- system.file("data-raw", package = "Rbills", mustWork = TRUE)

# Choose 'example_powerbill' file.
x <- list.files(path, "powerbill")

# Type Bldg 85, Main Bldg, East Bldg, West Bldg 1, West Bldg 2 when prompt function occurs.
power_table <- read_pdf_rmp(path, x, building_names = c("Bldg 85", "Main Bldg", "East Bldg", "West Bldg 1", "West Bldg 2"))
```

Then you can see the table of data

```{r}
knitr::kable(power_table)
```


## Using the gas bill function

Summit Energy gas bills include all the crucial information about each building. The following png is the example of gasbill pdf file of Summit Energy. This is the first page of the *example_gasbill.pdf* included with the package. Notice that you will be able to see the billing month, invoice number, invoice date, and so on. 

![](example_gasbill_frontpage.PNG)

```{r}
path <- system.file("data-raw", package = "Rbills", mustWork = TRUE)

# Choose 'example_gasbill' file.
x <- list.files(path, "gasbill")

gas_table <- read_pdf_seg(path, x)
```

Then you can see the table of data
```{r}
knitr::kable(gas_table)
```
